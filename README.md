Requirements

The server expects you to have Chrome installed in the default location for each system:


# Quick installation

**Mac users with Homebrew installed:** brew tap homebrew/cask && brew cask install chromedriver

**Debian based Linux distros:** sudo apt-get install chromium-chromedriver

**Windows users with Chocolatey installed:** choco install chromedriver


#Before you run the automation test

1. Make sure you have installed chromedriver. Type  "which chromedriver" from terminal and you should see "/usr/local/bin/chromedriver"


#Mac users if you need to install homebrew 

/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
